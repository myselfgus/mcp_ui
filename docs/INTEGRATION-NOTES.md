# Integration Notes (Ongoing Log)

This log documents concrete integration steps executed during the build-out of the unified agent platform.

## 2025-08-17
- Cloned `fast-agent` into `third_party/fast-agent`.
- Cloned `ai2go` into `third_party/ai2go` (multi-service micro-architecture reference).
- Cloned `tools` into `third_party/tools` (large catalog of MCP-related servers & examples).
- Added CI jobs (Node, Ruby, Docs, Python) + CodeQL + Dependabot + Release flows.
- Added Cloud Run deployment workflow for fast-agent service.
- Authored `ARCHITECTURE-AI2GO.md` describing unified plan (UI + Orchestrator + Tools + Speech + Retrieval + Security).
- Added Python UI adapter for `fast-agent` returning `UIResource` examples.

## Pending / Upcoming
- ~~Scaffold orchestrator service with provider abstraction.~~ ✅ COMPLETED
- ~~Introduce speech layer (OpenAI + Google) with unified interface.~~ ✅ OpenAI COMPLETED  
- ~~Add persistence layer (Session, Message, ToolExecution) with SQLite foundation.~~ ✅ COMPLETED
- Add retrieval/indexing prototype (embedding + search).
- Integrate selected tool servers from `third_party/tools` (prioritize: `genai-toolbox`, `cloud-run-mcp`, `computer-control-mcp`).

## 2025-08-17 (Later Updates)
- Added /tools endpoint, fs.apply_patch tool, logging middleware.
- Expanded orchestrator README and .env.example.
- Added tests for tools list and patch application.

## 2025-08-17 (Speech & Persistence Implementation)
- **COMPLETED: Speech Subsystem**
  - Added speech provider abstraction in `orchestrator/speech/base.py`
  - Implemented OpenAI Whisper/TTS provider in `orchestrator/speech/openai_provider.py`
  - Created speech tools (`speech.transcribe`, `speech.synthesize`) in `orchestrator/speech/tools.py`
  - Added speech provider registry and configuration settings
  - Added `/speech/providers` endpoint to API
  
- **COMPLETED: Persistence Layer**
  - Added database models (Session, Message, ToolExecution) in `orchestrator/persistence/models.py`
  - Implemented SQLite-based async database with aiosqlite
  - Added database schema initialization and CRUD operations
  - Integrated persistence into chat flow with automatic logging
  - Added tool execution tracking with status and timing
  
- **COMPLETED: Configuration & Integration**
  - Extended settings with speech and persistence configuration
  - Updated `.env.example` with new configuration options
  - Added conditional imports to support optional dependencies
  - Integrated speech tools into existing tool registry
  - Added database initialization to API startup
  - Enhanced health check endpoint with feature flags
  
- **COMPLETED: Tests & Documentation**
  - Added comprehensive tests for speech providers and persistence
  - Created integration tests for speech tools and API endpoints
  - Updated README with speech and persistence features documentation
  - Added migration path documentation for SQLite -> Postgres
  - Created detailed implementation documentation

**Architecture Changes:**
- Speech follows existing provider pattern (similar to OpenAI/Gemini chat providers)
- Persistence is optional and configurable (ENABLE_PERSISTENCE flag)
- Database schema designed for future Postgres migration
- All new features integrate seamlessly with existing tool registry and chat flow

**Next Priority:**
- Add Google Cloud Speech provider for speech diversity
- Implement retrieval/embedding layer for semantic search
- Add Postgres migration utilities and scripts
- Enhance rate limiting and authentication middleware

(Continue appending entries for every structural change.)
