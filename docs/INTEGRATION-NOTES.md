# Integration Notes (Ongoing Log)

This log documents concrete integration steps executed during the build-out of the unified agent platform.

## 2025-08-17
- Cloned `fast-agent` into `third_party/fast-agent`.
- Cloned `ai2go` into `third_party/ai2go` (multi-service micro-architecture reference).
- Cloned `tools` into `third_party/tools` (large catalog of MCP-related servers & examples).
- Added CI jobs (Node, Ruby, Docs, Python) + CodeQL + Dependabot + Release flows.
- Added Cloud Run deployment workflow for fast-agent service.
- Authored `ARCHITECTURE-AI2GO.md` describing unified plan (UI + Orchestrator + Tools + Speech + Retrieval + Security).
- Added Python UI adapter for `fast-agent` returning `UIResource` examples.

## 2025-08-17 (Speech & Memory Implementation)
- **Implemented Speech Subsystem**: Added `SpeechProvider` interface with OpenAI (Whisper + TTS) and Google stub implementations
- **Added Speech API endpoints**: `/speech/transcribe` (multipart/JSON), `/speech/tts`, `/speech/providers`
- **Created Speech tools**: `speech.transcribe` and `speech.synthesize` integrated with chat system
- **Implemented Memory/Persistence Layer**: 4-axis architecture (ontology, parsing, vectors, graphs) with SQLModel
- **Added Memory API endpoints**: `/memory/retrieve`, `/memory/store`, `/memory/stats` with cross-axis search
- **Created Memory tools**: `memory.search` and `memory.store` with embedding support
- **Enhanced Chat integration**: `include_memory=true` parameter for context-augmented conversations
- **Database initialization**: SQLite default with PostgreSQL support via `DATABASE_URL`
- **Vector search**: Naive cosine similarity with lexical fallback when embeddings unavailable
- **Embedding providers**: OpenAI text-embedding-3-small (default) with Google stub
- **Comprehensive testing**: Added 16+ tests covering providers, tools, API endpoints
- **Updated documentation**: Enhanced README with usage examples, updated architecture docs
- **Configuration expansion**: Added speech and memory environment variables to .env.example

## Pending / Upcoming
- Advanced vector similarity with pgvector for production deployments
- Real Google Cloud Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech integration
- Enhanced retrieval algorithms and chunking strategies
- Graph relationship expansion and traversal algorithms
- Rate limiting and authentication for production use

## 2025-08-17 (Later Updates)
- Added /tools endpoint, fs.apply_patch tool, logging middleware.
- Expanded orchestrator README and .env.example.
- Added tests for tools list and patch application.
