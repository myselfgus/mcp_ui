# Integration Notes (Ongoing Log)

This log documents concrete integration steps executed during the build-out of the unified agent platform.

## 2025-08-17
- Cloned `fast-agent` into `third_party/fast-agent`.
- Cloned `ai2go` into `third_party/ai2go` (multi-service micro-architecture reference).
- Cloned `tools` into `third_party/tools` (large catalog of MCP-related servers & examples).
- Added CI jobs (Node, Ruby, Docs, Python) + CodeQL + Dependabot + Release flows.
- Added Cloud Run deployment workflow for fast-agent service.
- Authored `ARCHITECTURE-AI2GO.md` describing unified plan (UI + Orchestrator + Tools + Speech + Retrieval + Security).
- Added Python UI adapter for `fast-agent` returning `UIResource` examples.

## Pending / Upcoming
- Scaffold orchestrator service with provider abstraction.
- Introduce speech layer (OpenAI + Google) with unified interface.
- Add retrieval/indexing prototype (embedding + search).
- Integrate selected tool servers from `third_party/tools` (prioritize: `genai-toolbox`, `cloud-run-mcp`, `computer-control-mcp`).

## 2025-08-17 (Later Updates)
- Added /tools endpoint, fs.apply_patch tool, logging middleware.
- Expanded orchestrator README and .env.example.
- Added tests for tools list and patch application.
