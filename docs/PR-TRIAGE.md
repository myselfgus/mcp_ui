# Pull Request Triage (Aug 17 2025)

Purpose: Provide a clear, incremental plan to reduce 15 open PRs to a clean, up‑to‑date `main` without losing functionality.

## Legend
- [ ] Not started
- [~] In progress / needs manual validation
- [x] Completed / resolved

## Feature PRs (Conflicting)
1. PR #1 feat: Implement speech and persistence modules
   - Status: [x] Closed as superseded (speech + basic memory already in main). Comment added referencing this doc.
   - Action: DONE
2. PR #15 Add Speech Subsystem and Memory Persistence (Four Axes)
   - Status: [x] Closed; advanced files deferred (embeddings, retrieval, db abstractions, google_stub, provider rename) documented below.
   - Decision: DONE
   - Follow-up (future PRs):
     - PR (future) embeddings + retrieval scaffolding
     - PR (future) multi-provider speech (google stub)

## Dependabot / Maintenance PRs (Mergeable)
Batch A (Low risk: GH Actions infra)
- PR #2 pnpm/action-setup 3 -> 4  Status: [x]
- PR #3 actions/checkout 4 -> 5   Status: [x]
- PR #4 actions/configure-pages 4 -> 5 Status: [x]

Batch B (Low risk: patch/minor libs)
- PR #5 isbot patch              Status: [ ]
- PR #7 @types/leaflet patch     Status: [ ]
- PR #12 @radix-ui/react-dialog patch Status: [ ]
- PR #14 prettier-plugin-tailwindcss patch Status: [ ]

Batch C (Higher attention: majors / large jumps)
- PR #6 @quilted/threads 3.1.3 -> 4.0.1 Status: [ ] Review changelog
- PR #8 zod 3.x -> 4.x           Status: [ ] Only used in `examples/server/src/index.ts`; verify v4 API compatibility
- PR #9 jsdom 22 -> 26           Status: [ ] Check Node engine & test suite
- PR #10 @cloudflare/vite-plugin 1.7.5 -> 1.11.5 Status: [ ] Validate `vite.config.ts` server config
- PR #11 @vitejs/plugin-react-swc 3.x -> 4.x Status: [ ] Confirm config options unchanged
- PR #13 @vitejs/plugin-react 4.6.0 -> 5.0.0 Status: [ ] React fast refresh behavior

## Execution Order
1. Close PR #1 and #15 (superseded & decomposed) after this document committed.
2. Merge Batch A sequentially (ensure CI green after each or use a single fast-forward if identical base).
3. Merge Batch B (can squash sequentially; minimal risk).
4. For Batch C, create a temporary branch `maintenance/deps-batch-c` and cherry-pick or merge one by one running tests between each.

## Backlog Items Extracted From PR #15
- Embedding interface & retrieval pipeline scaffolding
- Dedicated database abstraction (beyond simple store) with migration story
- Speech multi-provider (google_stub) + provider registry upgrades
- Memory tool consolidation (single tools module) & advanced vector search

## Acceptance Criteria for This Cleanup Phase
- `main` has zero open conflicting PRs
- All low-risk dependency PRs merged
- High-risk PRs queued with explicit validation steps
- Backlog documented (this file) and referenced in closed feature PR comments

## Current State Snapshot
- Conflitos: PR #1, #15
- Total Open: 15
- After closing #1 & #15: 13 (all maintenance)
